# Contribution Guide 

First of all, I would like Thank you for showing interest as I greatly appreciate your efforts towards making this project better. 

## How to setup?

This is the most simple project when it comes to contributions, setup, opening issues/pull requests + you get to practice competitive questions.

So let's get started.

- Clone the repo using the command 
`git clone https://github.com/sunnysetia93/competitive-coding-problems.git`

##### NOTE: Programming Language is not a constraint. Pseudo code (in form of comments) is also appreciated as It can be solved by one of us later.

## How to pick up an Issue
- Comment on the issue first so that we can assign you the issue. 
- If you raise a Pull Request for an issue and the Issue was not assigned to you, your PR will be marked as **Invalid**

## Submittng a Pull Request (PR)
- Add yourself to the assignee section
- Add meaningful heading and description to your PR
- Also mention the issue number in the description using **'#'**, e.g: **#12**
- Not following the above will mark your PR invalid

## Adding your code

- When adding a new problem with a solution
  - A problem statement should be there in form of comments and support it with some examples (Refer this [Example](https://github.com/sunnysetia93/competitive-coding-problems/blob/master/Leetcode_April_Challenge_Covid19/05-bestTimeToBuyAndSellStock2.js))
  - It would be great if you can mention the **Run Time Complexity** of your solution
  - Please take care of the segregation of the Problems as per the given Folder Structure
  - It's great if you can add the Unit Tests to verify your solutions as well.
- When adding a Unit Test
     - Take care of the file name convention
